<h1 class="section-heading mb-3">About this site</h1>
<p>This ant keeping guide is meant to pull good, practical information into one place.</p>
<p>Each species page focuses on the things keepers care about most: temperature, humidity, diapause, founding style, setups by colony size, diet, and common issues.</p>
<p>The nuptial flight and forum sections help the community share what actually works in the real world.</p>
<p class="text-muted small">This project was built with Django, Bootstrap, and a small swarm of virtual ants.</p>
